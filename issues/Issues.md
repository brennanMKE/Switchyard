# Switchyard

Switchyard is a SwiftUI macOS git client with an agent-facing CLI (`yard`), built so a coding agent
is a first-class user of the repository alongside a human. macOS only. This tracker covers the
whole repo: the `YardGit` engine, the `YardKit` package, the `yard` CLI, the app and its broker
agent, the generated agent skill, and the docs. The project is pre-implementation, so most issues
here are **implementation tasks derived from the milestones**, not bug reports — the format bends
accordingly (see "Task issues" below).

This file is the local guide for managing issues in this project. The companion Mac app (Issues.app) watches the `issues/` folder and renders the current state. Markdown files (and `project.json`) are the source of truth — there is no generated artifact or index to keep in sync.

The `# {Project Name}` heading above should match the `name` field in `issues/project.json`. `project.json` is the canonical source for the project's identity (name + repo URL); this guide is the workflow companion.

## Project config (`project.json`)

A small JSON file naming the project and its repo. Two required fields:

```json
{
  "name": "{Project Name}",
  "url": "https://github.com/user/repo"
}
```

- `name` — the project's human-readable name. Match the heading at the top of this file.
- `url` — the project's canonical web URL (HTTPS form, not SSH). Typically a GitHub URL; GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. work too.

When the repo moves or renames, edit `project.json` directly. Don't infer the project's name from the parent folder path — `project.json` is authoritative.

## Status values

| File value | Display name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | Open | Filed but not yet started |
| `in-progress` | In Progress | Actively being worked on |
| `resolved` | Resolved | Work is done; awaiting user confirmation |
| `closed` | Closed | User has confirmed the fix |
| `wontfix` | Won't Fix | Acknowledged but won't be addressed |

Use the **file value** (lowercase, hyphenated) in the issue's metadata table. The Mac app converts to the display name when rendering.

## Critical rule: never close without explicit confirmation

The most important rule of this workflow: an issue must **never** be marked `resolved`, `closed`, or `wontfix` based on inference. Only when the user has said so in plain language. Specifically, do not infer resolution from:

- a code change you (or a subagent) just made
- a commit message
- the filing of a related issue
- the user saying "thanks, that looks better"

Leave status at `open` (or `in-progress` if work has started) until the user confirms in words like "close this", "this is fixed", "mark resolved", or "won't fix". When in doubt, ask.

The deliberate exception: a subagent that finishes a fix may set `resolved` (work-is-done-but-not-confirmed). It must not set `closed` — that's the user's call. This separation is the entire reason `resolved` and `closed` are different states.

## Git tracking

This project's choice on whether `issues/` is in git determines whether lifecycle events produce commits. Check on every operation:

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null   # is this a git repo?
git check-ignore -q issues/                        # exit 0 = ignored, 1 = tracked
```

- **Not a git repo, or `issues/` is ignored**: edit files only; never commit. The Mac app still tracks changes from the working copy.
- **`issues/` is tracked**: each lifecycle event below produces its own commit.

When tracked:

| Event | What's committed | Commit message |
|---|---|---|
| Initial setup | `project.json` + `Issues.md` together | `Add issue tracker setup` (or bundle with the first `#NNNN` commit) |
| File a new issue | the new `NNNN.md` (and `project.json` / `Issues.md` if newly created) | `#NNNN <issue title>` |
| Edit project config | `project.json` only | `Update project config` (or e.g. `Update project URL`) |
| Resolve — code commit | code changes only | `#NNNN <verb> <title>` |
| Resolve — resolution commit | markdown update (status + Closed + Commit + summary) | `#NNNN Resolve: <title>` |
| Bail with notes | markdown only | `#NNNN Notes: <brief>` |
| User-confirmed close | markdown only | `#NNNN Close` |
| Won't fix | markdown only | `#NNNN Won't fix` |

**Working-copy-only changes (no commit):**

- Setting status to `in-progress` at the start of work — transient; the resolve commits supersede it. Committing every status flip would create noise.

**Why two commits to resolve, not one:** the **Commit** metadata row records the hash of the code-fix commit, and that hash isn't known until *after* the code commit lands. Splitting resolution into a code commit and a resolution commit keeps each commit single-purpose ("fix the code", "document the fix") and lets the resolution commit reference the hash cleanly.

## Issue file format

Each issue is `NNNN.md` (4-digit zero-padded) with this structure:

```markdown
# NNNN — Title

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | open |
| **Module** | <module name(s)> |
| **Platform** | iOS · macOS · iPadOS · All |
| **First seen** | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Description

What is wrong. Lead with the punchline — the first paragraph shows in the Mac app summary.

## Steps to reproduce

1. …
2. …

## Expected behavior

What should happen.

## Actual behavior

What actually happens.

## Attachments

![caption](NNNN/screenshot.png)

## Notes

Any additional context, guesses at root cause, related code locations.
```

### Task issues

Most issues in this project are implementation tasks rather than bug reports, so:

- A **`**Milestone**`** row is added to the metadata table (`M0`–`M5`, or `—` for cross-cutting
  work). Milestones are defined in `docs/switchyard-development-guide.md` §9 and are ordered:
  nothing in M1 starts before M0 lands.
- **`## Description`** says what to build and why it matters.
- **`## Expected behavior`** is the done-criteria checklist. An issue is not resolvable until every
  box is genuinely true — and per the verification rule below, "it compiles" is never one of them.
- **`## Steps to reproduce`** and **`## Actual behavior`** are omitted; they mean nothing for a task.
- **`## Notes`** carries dependencies (`Blocked by #NNNN`) and the authoritative doc section.

Real bugs found later use the standard bug shape with all sections.

### Work log

Every resolved issue ends with a `## Work log` section recording who did the work and what it cost:

```markdown
## Work log

| | |
|---|---|
| **Agent** | OpenCode |
| **Model** | ornith-1.0-35b-mlx-oq8 (local, LM Studio) |
| **Token cost** | $0.00 (local inference) |
| **Wall time** | 14m |
```

Local models cost **$0.00** — that is the point of running them, and recording it makes the saving
visible rather than assumed. Wall time is still recorded, because local inference trades money for
time and the trade is only worth evaluating if both numbers exist.

When a hosted model does the work, record its name and actual token cost instead. When work is split
— a local model implements, a hosted model reviews — record both rows so the split is legible.

### Format details that matter

- **Title separator** is an em-dash (U+2014, `—`), not a hyphen.
- **Metadata field rows** must keep the field name in `**bold**` exactly.
- **Dates** are `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Module** can list multiple modules separated by ` / ` (e.g. `BlueskyFeed / BlueskyDataStore`).
- **Platform** is `iOS`, `macOS`, `iPadOS`, `All`, or any other string. `All` is treated as matching every platform filter.
- When status moves to `resolved` or `closed`, add a `**Closed**` row with today's date. When the move to `resolved` is the result of a fix commit, also add a `**Commit**` row with the short hash (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`).
- Steps / Expected / Actual / Attachments / Notes are conventional but not all required — for design-refinement or feature-gap issues, Description alone is fine.

## Filing a new issue

1. Confirm `issues/project.json` exists. If missing, create it (see schema above) before filing the first issue — `name` should match this guide's heading; `url` is the project's canonical web URL (HTTPS, not SSH).
2. Find the highest existing `NNNN.md` and increment. Start at `0001` if the folder is empty. Skip past reserved high numbers (e.g. `8888`, `9999` for test issues).
3. Create `issues/NNNN.md` from the template.
4. Set status to `open`.
5. Use today's date for First seen.
6. Phrase the title as a single declarative sentence describing the bug, not a question or a fix description.
7. **If `issues/` is tracked by git**, commit the new file with message `#NNNN <issue title>` so the issue enters git history with its `open` status. If ignored, skip.

## Updating an issue

Edit the file in place. The Mac app picks up changes automatically — no follow-up command. Touch only the rows or sections that changed; don't reformat the rest.

When status moves to `resolved` or `closed`, add a `**Closed**` row with the date. When the move to `resolved` was driven by a fix commit, also add a `**Commit**` row with the short hash. For any move toward `resolved`, `closed`, or `wontfix`, the "Critical rule" near the top of this file applies — those transitions require explicit user confirmation, not inference.

## Implementation is delegated to OpenCode running a local model

Implementation work on this project is handed to **OpenCode** driving **Ornith 1.0 35B-A3B** (8-bit
MLX) locally through **LM Studio**. Token cost is $0.00; the cost is wall time and the ceiling is the
model's capability. Configuration lives in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, pointed at
`http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1`.

Dispatch one issue per run, from the repo root:

```sh
opencode run "Work issue 0012. Follow issues/Issues.md and AGENTS.md. Stop and report if blocked."
lms ps   # confirm the model is loaded before dispatching
```

### AGENTS.md is what OpenCode actually reads

**OpenCode loads `AGENTS.md` into its system prompt. It does not load `CLAUDE.md`.** This was
verified, not assumed: asked to state the GitUp licensing rule with only `CLAUDE.md` present, the
model answered `UNKNOWN`; with `AGENTS.md` present it recited the rule correctly.

So `AGENTS.md` duplicates the two non-negotiable rule sets — the GPL/MIT clean-room separation and
the code-signing prohibitions — inline rather than by reference, because a pointer is not reliable
enough when the failure mode is a legal problem or an account-wide certificate revocation.
**`CLAUDE.md` stays canonical; any change to those rules must be mirrored into `AGENTS.md` in the
same commit.**

### What is not delegated

Some work stays with a human or a hosted model, because the cost of getting it wrong is not a bug:

- **Anything touching the clean-room boundary** — #0015, #0025, #0027, #0060, #0075. A model that
  reaches for GitUp's source or fixtures creates a licensing problem that a code review will not
  reliably catch, since the output looks like ordinary Swift.
- **Anything touching signing, certificates, or archives.** Rule 2 in `AGENTS.md`.
- **The M0 spikes** (#0001–#0005). They are judgment and written findings, not code, and a wrong
  answer here mis-sequences the entire project.
- **Marking an issue `resolved`.** A delegated run reports what it did; verification is confirmed
  independently before status moves. The critical rule above is not delegable.

Good delegation targets are the opposite: self-contained, precisely specified, with done-criteria
that a test can settle. Most of M1's read commands qualify once #0006 lands.

## Resolving an issue (the standard workflow)

Each open issue is handled by a fresh subagent. The orchestrator picks the issue; the subagent does the work in isolation and returns when done.

### Orchestrator: pick and dispatch

1. List `issues/*.md` (skip `Issues.md`). Pick the lowest-numbered file whose status is `open`.
2. Spawn a fresh subagent with the issue id and instructions to follow the resolve workflow below.
3. When the subagent returns, move on to the next open issue (or stop if only one was requested).

If the user names a specific issue ("fix 0046"), dispatch to that id directly.

### Subagent: claim → fix → build → commit → resolve

A subagent starts with fresh context, so its first job is loading the project's conventions before touching anything.

1. **Orient in the project.** Read these in order, every time:
   - **`issues/Issues.md`** (this file) — status vocabulary, module conventions, build/verify command, commit conventions, project-specific rules. **Authoritative for issue-tracking workflow.**
   - **`CLAUDE.md`** at the repo root, if it exists — project-wide guidance, code conventions, restricted areas, build/test commands. **Treat its instructions as binding.**
   - **`issues/NNNN.md`** — the issue you're working on, in full, including attachments in `issues/NNNN/`.

   If the two project guides disagree, prefer `CLAUDE.md` for code/repo conventions and this file for issue-tracking specifics.

2. **Set status to `in-progress`** in the markdown — working copy only, no commit. The Mac app picks it up immediately.
3. **Make the code changes** required to fix the bug.
4. **Build *and* run the project's verification command, and confirm tests actually executed and passed.** This step is mandatory and cannot be shortcutted.

   - **Compilation is not verification.** "It builds" / "it compiles" / "no type errors" does not count. Tests must actually run — unit tests execute, UI tests run on a simulator, the app launches, whatever the project defines as proof. A green build with zero tests run is a failure of this step.
   - **If you wrote or modified tests as part of the fix, you MUST execute those specific tests and observe them pass.** Confirm the test names you added appear in the run output, the counts increased, and the result was success. A test that compiles but never ran proves nothing.
   - **Read the output, don't just check the exit code.** "0 tests run", "skipped", "no tests found", or a "build succeeded" line with no test summary are red flags even when the exit code is 0. iOS in particular will report `xcodebuild` success when no tests actually executed.
   - **If verification cannot be run in your environment** (no simulator, missing credentials, hardware required, sandbox), you have not verified the fix. Do not mark the issue `resolved` — bail per "When the subagent can't finish" below, naming the verification step you couldn't run.
   - **If the build was already failing before you started**, note it on the issue and bail — don't fix unrelated breakage.

5. **Make the code commit.** Stage *only the code changes* (not the issue markdown yet). The message starts with `#NNNN` and a short, declarative title — pick the verb that actually fits (`Fix`, `Add`, `Refactor`, `Update`, `Remove`, etc.); not every issue is a bug fix. Leave a blank line after the title, then add a paragraph of details. Example:

   ```
   #0046 Add navigation from avatar tap to profile

   The avatar tap on PostCardView was not wired to any NavigationLink.
   Threaded the author DID through the cell and connected onTapGesture
   to push ProfileView.
   ```

6. **Capture the commit hash** with `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.

7. **Update the issue markdown** to mark it resolved. **Precondition:** step 4 actually executed and passed. If it didn't, bail — don't resolve.

   - Change Status to `resolved`.
   - Add a `**Closed**` row with today's date.
   - Add a `**Commit**` row with the short hash from step 6.

   Then add a structured summary in this order so the issue becomes a primary-source record:

   - **`## Root cause`** — what was actually wrong (often different from the original report).
   - **`## Fix`** — the approach taken.
   - **`## Verification`** — the exact command(s) run and what was observed (e.g. "`xcodebuild test -scheme MyAppUITests` — 14 tests passed including the 3 new tests in `ReplyButtonUITests`"). If new tests were added, name them and confirm they ran. Mandatory — this is the audit trail that distinguishes "verified" from "compiled and hoped".
   - **`## Files changed`** — bulleted list, one bullet per file, with a short note describing what changed in each.
   - **`## Gotchas`** *(optional)* — surprises, dead ends, non-obvious behavior, or anything a future engineer working on similar code should know. Skip if nothing is notable. Be specific — these notes accumulate across issues and feed future "common pitfalls" docs.
   - **`## Work log`** — agent, model, token cost, wall time. See "Work log" above. Local runs record `$0.00`.

8. **If `issues/` is tracked by git, make the resolution commit.** Stage `issues/NNNN.md` and commit with message `#NNNN Resolve: <title>`. Body briefly notes which code commit it pairs with (the hash from step 6). If `issues/` is ignored or there's no repo, skip — the markdown change from step 7 is the entire record.

Status flow: `open` → `in-progress` → `resolved`. **Never set `closed`** — the user does that after verifying the fix.

### Build / verify command for this project

**Read `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root first — its code-signing rules are binding and non-negotiable.**
Never pass `-allowProvisioningUpdates`, never touch certificates or keychains, and stop rather than
retry on any signing stop-word.

```sh
# Package tests — the primary suite. Touches no signing assets, so prefer it.
cd YardKit && swift build && swift test

# App unit tests. UI tests cannot run here — the runner times out enabling automation mode.
xcodebuild -project Switchyard.xcodeproj -scheme Switchyard \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:SwitchyardTests test

# Unsigned compile check
xcodebuild build -project Switchyard.xcodeproj -scheme Switchyard \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO -quiet
```

`YardKit/` does not exist until #0006. Until then, verification for an issue is whatever that issue
names in its Expected behavior — usually a written finding in `docs/`.

Project-specific verification rules:

- **Engine work must be verified against both ref formats.** Fixture repos are built with the
  default format *and* `git init --ref-format=reftable`. A test suite that only ran against one has
  not verified the fix.
- **Journal work must be verified by a real round trip** — mutate, undo, assert the repository is
  byte-identical to the pre-state including refs, index, and worktree. Not by reading the code.
- **XPC work cannot be verified by unit tests alone.** Use the manual verification script (#0054)
  and say in `## Verification` which scenarios were exercised.

### When the subagent can't finish

If the bug is unreproducible, out of scope, or the build won't pass after reasonable effort:

1. **Discard or stash any partial code changes** so the bail doesn't accidentally include half-done work.
2. **Revert status to `open`** in the issue markdown so the issue goes back into the queue.
3. **Add a `## Notes` section** describing what was tried, why work stopped, and what you'd try next. Be specific.
4. **If `issues/` is tracked by git**, commit the markdown change with message `#NNNN Notes: <one-line bail summary>`. If ignored, skip.
5. Return with a one-line summary of why work stalled.

Never use `wontfix` or `closed` to escape a stuck issue.

## Attachments

Screenshots, crash logs, console output, sample data, etc. live in a sibling folder `issues/NNNN/`. Reference them with paths *relative to the issue's `.md` file* — that means the folder prefix `NNNN/` is part of the link target. The bytes that ship are `1335/screenshot.png`, not `screenshot.png` and not `issues/1335/screenshot.png`.

```
issues/1335.md           ← the markdown that contains the link
issues/1335/screenshot.png   ← the file being linked

# inside 1335.md the link reads:
![caption](1335/screenshot.png)
```

Concrete example with both image and video attachments:

```markdown
## Attachments

![Reply button does nothing when tapped](1335/screenshot.png)
![Crash log](1335/crash.log)
[![Sidebar resize jitter](1335/sidebar-resize-jitter.poster.png)](1335/sidebar-resize-jitter.mov)
```

### Videos (`.mov`, `.mp4`, etc.)

Videos can't be embedded as `![…](…)` — markdown renderers treat that as an `<img>` and a `.mov` won't load. Instead, generate a poster frame with `qlmanage` and emit an image-inside-a-link (shown in the example above). Quick recipe — copy the video into `issues/NNNN/` first, then:

```bash
qlmanage -t -s 1280 -o issues/NNNN issues/NNNN/<basename>.<ext>
mv issues/NNNN/<basename>.<ext>.png issues/NNNN/<basename>.poster.png
```

`qlmanage` ships with macOS — no install. It reliably produces posters for AVFoundation-supported formats: `.mov`, `.mp4`, `.m4v`, `.qt`. For `.avi` it usually works; for `.mkv` and `.webm` it generally fails on stock macOS unless a third-party Quick Look generator is installed. If the rename step doesn't produce the `.poster.png`, fall back to the plain `![alt](NNNN/file.mov)` form with a `<!-- poster generation failed -->` HTML comment in the Attachments section. Don't apply the link wrapper to plain images, and don't generate posters for animated GIFs.

### macOS screenshot / screen recording filename gotcha

macOS Screenshot and Screen Recording filenames both use a **narrow no-break space** (U+202F) before AM/PM, visually identical to a regular space. A literal `cp` of the quoted filename will fail with "No such file or directory". Use a glob to skip past it:

```bash
mkdir -p issues/NNNN
cp ~/Desktop/Screenshot\ YYYY-MM-DD\ at\ H.MM.SS*PM.png issues/NNNN/screenshot.png
cp ~/Desktop/Screen\ Recording\ YYYY-MM-DD\ at\ H.MM.SS*PM.mov issues/NNNN/recording.mov
```

The `*` matches the U+202F. Substitute the actual timestamp; if you don't know which file the user means, list `~/Desktop/Screenshot*` or `~/Desktop/Screen\ Recording*` by mtime and pick the most recent.

## Licensing rule that applies to every issue

GitUp (`../GitUp`, relative to the repo root) is **GPLv3**; Switchyard is **MIT**. Never copy GitUp
source, in any language, including line-by-line Objective-C to Swift translation, and never copy its
test fixtures. Read it to understand a problem, then close it and write your own. RemoteControl
(`../../RemoteControl`) is MIT by the same author and *may* be copied freely. Full rules in
`CLAUDE.md` and `docs/switchyard-development-guide.md` §2.
